# Introduction

- Associate Director, Statistics & Data Science at Pharmalex: support pharmaceutical companies in drug development
- Gravitated towards blockchain technology and the place of data science within it
- Lots of data available on the blockchain (~ 1x10^6 transaction per day on ethereum), how to access it? 
- Obtaining cryptocurrencies price data is straightforward, more sophisticated data manipulations require access to the “source” data

## Blockchain is hard to read

1.  Several Tb of data. Ethereum ~ 6x10^9 transactions.

2.  Data are stored sequentially, requires developing specific tools to follow a transaction.

3.  The structure of a transaction is difficult to read

4.  Fragmentation of blockchain technologies

:::

## How to get the data ?

1. Set-up an ETL: Extract, Transform and Load. Most flexible but need to set up a server with huge and fast hard-drives.
2. Use data providers:
  - Dashboards: Dune analytics, Nansen, GraphSense, icy.tools,...
  - APIs (software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other): OpenSea, Etherscan, Infura, The Graph,...
  
Two examples implemented in R:

  1. How to track and visualize NFT transactions on Ethereum
  2. Blockchain IoT data visualization and the rise of the Helium network

# NFTs

![https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks](figures/cryptopunks.jpg){height=200px fig-align="center"}

- Non-Fungible Tokens: represent ownership of unique items (art, collectibles, patents, real estate,...) 
- Smart contracts: decentralized programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met
- What can we do with NFT-related data ?

## NFTs price analysis with OpenSea API

OpenSea: big NFT market place

```{r}
resOpenSea <- GET("https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/events",
          query = list(limit = 300, 
                       event_type = "successful", 
                       only_opensea = "true")) 
```

:::: {layout="[[60, 40]]" layout-valign="center"}

![](figures/glimpse.png)

![](figures/pieChartOpenSea.png){height=200px}

::::

- 300 transactions max, limited to OpenSea transactions
- Pre-processed by OpenSea and not raw blockchain transactions
- Mainly price analysis
- Analysis done in June 2021: [Link](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/data-science-on-blockchain-with-r-afaf09f7578c)

## NFTs tracking with EtherScan API: the data

::: {.panel-tabset}

### The Weird Whales

![https://weirdwhalesnft.com/](figures/patchwork.png){height=300px fig-align="center"}

- Weird Whales: collection of 3350 whales programmatically generated, each with their unique characteristics and traits. Created by a 12-year-old programmer named Benyamin Ahmed who made the buzz. 
- EtherScan: block explorer to view information about transactions, verify contract code... $\rightarrow$ access to *more raw* data
- Analysis done in October 2021 and updated in December 2022: [Link](https://tdemarchin.github.io/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartII//DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartII.html)


### Events: Reverse engineering

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Weird Whales are managed by a specific smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. You can find it on [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/).

- To make it easier to extract information from the blockchain, we can read the events: dispatched signals (easy to read) the smart contracts can fire.

### Transfer and sales price

```{r}
resEventTransfer <- GET("https://api.etherscan.io/api",
                          query = list(module = "logs", 
                                       action = "getLogs", 
                                       fromBlock = fromBlock, 
                                       toBlock = "latest",
                                       address = "0x96ed81c7f4406eff359e27bff6325dc3c9e042bd", 
                                       topic0 = "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
                                       apikey = EtherScanAPIToken)) 
```

![](figures/glimpseWeirdWhales.png){height="150px" fig-align="center"}

Where is the sales price? On OpenSea, sales are managed by the main contract and if approved, the second contract is called (here Weird Whales), which then triggers the transfer $\rightarrow$ need to download all the transactions from the OpenSea main smart contract address and then filter for the ones related to Weird Whales (~ 10000 API calls, can take several hours...). 

### ETH/USD conversion

![](figures/ETHUSD.png){height="400px" fig-align="center"}

- Ethereum / USD rate is highly volatile, need to obtain the historical ETH market price if we want to convert ETH to USD.
- A spline is fitted on data from the CoinGecko API

### Descriptive statistics

![](figures/descriptiveStatWeirdWhales.png){fig-align="center"}

### Sales price evolution

![](figures/salesPriceEvolution.png){height=350px fig-align="center"}

- High variability in prices at the begining (buzz), followed by a quieter period
- Some NFTs are exchanged outside the OpenSea Market (price = 0) $\rightarrow$ difficult to trace....
- Starting March 2022, all sales price felt to 0 $\rightarrow$ OpenSea was hacked in March, they probably updated their smart contract... 

### Network

- Perfect data to be plotted as a network

- Networks are described by:

  - Vertices (or nodes): the wallet addresses
  - Edges (or links): the transactions

- *network* package:

```{r}
# create the network using network function
network <- network(edges,  
                   vertex.attr = vertices)
```

### Static network

:::: {layout="[[50, 50]]" layout-valign="center"}

![](figures/staticNetwork.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- Each color represents a unique token ID (we restricted to tokens involved in at least 10 transactions to improve visibility)
- All transactions of all the tokens originate from the single minting address (1)
- Some addresses are involved in multiple transactions (curved edges)
- Some tokens were transferred to an address only to be sent back to the sender...? 
- Made with the *ggraph* packages

::::

### Longitudinal dimension

![](figures/timeline.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

About 2/3 of the transactions happened very shortly after the NFT’s creation

### Dynamic network

![](figures/dynamicNetwork.mp4){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- Made with the *network* and *networkDynamic* packages

# Helium IoT network 

:::: {layout="[[-5, 40, -5, 20, -5, 20, -5]]" layout-valign="center"}

![Helium, the people’s network. Photo from Nima Mot.](figures/peopleNetwork.jpg)

![A miner](figures/miner.png)

![Rewards](figures/rewardsHelium.png)

::::

- Helium: decentralized wireless infrastructure for IoT devices (environmental sensors, localisation sensors to track bike fleets,...), relies on a blockchain
- People are incentivized to install hotspots and become a part of the network by earning Helium tokens 
- Questions:
  - How big is the Helium network infrastructure, where are located the hotspots?
  - Are they actively utilized, i.e. are they used to transfer data with connected devices?
- Need to download the full blockchain $\rightarrow$ Dewi ETL project is a dedicated ETL server $\rightarrow$ CSV extracts in 10k/50k-block increments on a web server: centralized, bad practice!
- Analysis done in March 2022: [Link](https://tdemarchin.github.io/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartIII/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartIII.html)


## Helium IoT network: infrastructure

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Geospatial indexing 

:::: {layout="[[50, 50]]" layout-valign="center"}

![Liege](figures/helium2.png)

![](figures/glimpseHelium1.png)
![](figures/descriptiveStatHelium1.png)

::::

- What is the size of the infrastructure? $\rightarrow$ hotspot data
- H3: geospatial indexing system using a hierarchical hexagonal grid.  At resolution 8:  earth is covered by 691,776,122 hexagons $\rightarrow$ we convert to lat/lng

### Growth and distribution

:::: {.columns aligm-items="center"}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](figures/hotspotDistribution.png){}

- Some owners own more than 50 hotspots!
- Three phases: (1) a slow linear increase, (2) an exponential increase in the middle of 2021 followed by (3) a fast linear increase (did it continue?)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Cumulative growth of the network infrastructure in terms of number of hotspots added](figures/growthHotspotHelium.png){}
:::

::::

### Location

![](figures/hotspotLocalizationHelium.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- We start by creating an empty world map on which we overlay the hotspot data. 
- Plotting all the individual hotspots on a map would be too much (> 500k hotspots) $\rightarrow$ we cluster the hotspots into hexagons (*hexbin* and *geom_hex*)
- Most hotspots are located in North America, Europe and Asia, mostly in big cities. Practically no hotspots in Africa, Russia and very few in South America. A few hotspots in the middle of the ocean... Data issue or cheating to increase rewards? 

:::

## Helium IoT network: network usage

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Data transactions

- We understood that hotspots are distributed on the planet and provide good coverage in big cities. Are they being actively used by connected devices and how often? $\rightarrow$ Transaction data
- We can look at network usage from two perspectives: (1) check the volume of data exchanged and (2) check how often the hotspots have been involved in data transfer with connected devices

![](figures/glimpseHelium2.png){fig-align="center"}


### Growth

:::: {layout="[[60, 40]]" layout-valign="center"}

![Total volume of data exchanged](figures/descriptiveStatHelium2.png)

![Cumulative sum of the number of transactions](figures/growthTransactionsHelium.png)
::::

- 40.48% hotspots did not participate in any transaction so far
- Total volume of data exchanged is probably not a good metric $\rightarrow$ network is intented to transfer small data across long distance
- Slow linear increase followed by an exponential increase, which is finally followed by a fast linear increase
- Glitch in November 2021: major outage of the blockchain
- Despite having about 15% of the hotspots, Asia don’t seem to be so active in terms of data transfer


### Dynamic plot

![Evolution of the number of transactions across the globe](figures/dynamicGrowthHelium.gif){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- Transactions mainly occur in North America before mid 2020, then followed by a strong wave in Europe and Asia. Barely no transaction have occurred in South America and Africa.
- Made with the *gganimate* package

### Interactive plot

:::: {layout="[[-12, 50, -12, 50, -12]]" layout-valign="center"}

![Distribution of the transactions in the US](figures/distributionTransactionsUS.webp)

![Distribution of the transactions in Belgium](figures/distributionTransactionsBE.webp)
::::

- US: Transactions are homogeneously distributed across the country although the peaks of activity (note that the legend is logarithmic!) are located around big cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami)
- BE: Transactions are not homogeneously distributed across the country $\rightarrow$ most transactions happen in the upper part of the country, which is consistent with the lower part of the country being scarcely populated (Ardennes)
- Made with the *rayshader* package, interactive version available in the [original article](https://tdemarchin.github.io/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartIII/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartIII.html)

# Conclusion

- Approaches for reading the blockchains and visualizing blockchain transactions 
- NFT: how to download and plot a network of transactions associated to a NFT collection $\rightarrow$ interesting patterns in the evolution of NFT prices, which can be linked to social media attention
- Helium: techniques on how to summarise and visualise the network growth in term of infrastructure and data usage $\rightarrow$ the infrastructure is well developed, the network has a lot of spare capacity

$\rightarrow$ obtaining data in an appropriate format requires a deep understanding of the blockchain

$\rightarrow$ visualisation of blockchain data is still challenging because of the huge amount of data, need data scientists to develop blockchain specific approaches

Next step: analyse the networks using the graph theory
