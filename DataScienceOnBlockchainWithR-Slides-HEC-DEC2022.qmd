# Introduction

- Associate Director, Statistics & Data Science at Pharmalex: support pharmaceutical companies in drug development
- Gravitated towards blockchain technology and the place of data science within it
- Lots of data available on the blockchain (~ 1x10^6 transaction per day on ethereum), how to access it? 
- Obtaining cryptocurrencies price data is straightforward, more sophisticated data manipulations require access to the “source” data

## Blockchain is accessible but hard to read

1.  Several Tb of data

2.  Data are stored sequentially, requires developing specific tools to follow a transaction.

3.  The structure of a transaction is difficult to read

4.  Fragmentation of blockchain technologies

## How to get the data ?

1. Set-up an ETL: Extract, Transform and Load. Most flexible but need to set up a server with huge and fast hard-drives.
2. Use data providers:
  - Dashboards: Dune analytics, Nansen, GraphSense, icy.tools,...
  - APIs (software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other): OpenSea, Etherscan, Infura, The Graph,...
  
Two examples implemented in R:

  1. How to track and visualize NFTs: OpenSea and EtherScan APIs 
  2. Blockchain IoT data visualization and the rise of the Helium network: full data dump from The Helium Foundation ETL

# NFTs

![](figures/cryptopunks.jpg){height=200px fig-align="center"}

- Non-Fungible Tokens: represent ownership of unique items (art, collectibles, patents, real estate,...) 
- Smart contracts: decentralized programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met
- What can we do with NFT-related data ?

## NFTs price analysis with OpenSea API

OpenSea: big NFT market place

```{r}
resOpenSea <- GET("https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/events",
          query = list(limit = 300, 
                       event_type = "successful", 
                       only_opensea = "true")) 
```

![](figures/pieChartOpenSea.png){height=200px}

:::

- 300 transactions max, limited to OpenSea transactions
- pre-processed by OpenSea and not raw blockchain transactions
- mainly price analysis
- Analysis done in June 2021: [Link](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/data-science-on-blockchain-with-r-afaf09f7578c)

## NFTs tracking with EtherScan API: the transfers

::: {.panel-tabset}

### The Weird Whales

![](figures/patchwork.png){height=300px fig-align="center"}

- Weird Whales: collection of 3350 whales programmatically generated, each with their unique characteristics and traits. Created by a 12-year-old programmer named Benyamin Ahmed who made the buzz. 
- EtherScan: block explorer to view information about transactions, verify contract code, visualize network data $\rightarrow$ access to *more raw* data
- Analysis done in October 2021 and updated in December 2022: [Link](https://tdemarchin.github.io/DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartII//DataScienceOnBlockchainWithR-PartII.html)


### Events: Reverse engineering

- Weird Whales are managed by a specific smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain

- To make it easier to extract information from the blockchain, we can read the events: dispatched signals (easy to read) the smart contracts can fire. 

![](figures/transferEvent.png)

### Transfer & Sales price

```{r}
resEventTransfer <- GET("https://api.etherscan.io/api",
                          query = list(module = "logs", 
                                       action = "getLogs", 
                                       fromBlock = fromBlock, 
                                       toBlock = "latest",
                                       address = "0x96ed81c7f4406eff359e27bff6325dc3c9e042bd", 
                                       topic0 = "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
                                       apikey = EtherScanAPIToken)) 
```

![](figures/glimpseWeirdWhales.png){fig-align="center"}

Where is the sales price? On OpenSea, sales are managed by the main contract and if approved, the second contract is called (here Weird Whales), which then triggers the transfer $\rightarrow$ need to download all the transactions from the OpenSea main smart contract address and then filter for the ones related to Weird Whales (~ 10000 API calls, can take several hours...). 

### ETH/USD conversion

![](figures/ETHUSD.png){fig-align="center"}

- Ethereum / USD rate is highly volatile, need to obtain the historical ETH market price if we want to convert ETH to USD.
- A spline is fitted on data from the CoinGecko API 

### Final dataset

### Descriptive statistics

![](figures/descriptiveStatWeirdWhales.png){fig-align="center"}

### Sales price evolution

![](figures/salesPriceEvolution.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- High variability in prices at the begining (buzz), followed by a quieter period.
- Starting March 2022, all sales price felt to 0 $\rightarrow$ OpenSea was hacked in March, they probably updated their smart contract... 

### Static network

::: {layout="[[50, 50]]" layout-valign="center"}

![](figures/staticNetwork.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- Networks are described by:

  - vertices (or nodes): the wallet addresses
  - edges (or links): the transactions

- Each color represents a unique token ID
- Made with the *network* and *ggraph* packages

:::

### Longitudinal dimension

![](figures/timeline.png){height=400px fig-align="center"}

About 2/3 of the transactions happened very shortly after the NFT’s creation

### Dynamic network

![](figures/dynamicNetwork.mp4){height=400px fig-align="center"}

- Made with the *network* and *networkDynamic* packages

# Helium IoT network

Helium is a decentralized wireless infrastructure for IoT devices (environmental sensors, localisation sensors to track bike fleets,...). It is a blockchain that leverages a decentralized global network of Hotspots. People are incentivized to install hotspots and become a part of the network by earning Helium tokens, which can be bought and sold like any other cryptocurrency.

- How big is the Helium network?
- Where are located the hotspots?
- Are they actively utilized, i.e. are they used to transfer data with connected devices?
